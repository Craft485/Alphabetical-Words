# Alphabetical Words

This project is a way for me to try and get an understanding of various programming languages such as

- Javascript (use `npm run search` while in the `JS` directory)

- Python

- And hopefully others and some point

I've created these scripts to generate an output file each time (`/out`) and read all datasets in `/datasets`
